<h4>Learning Angular</h4>
<p>The Atlas BootCamp exists to guide motivated individuals toward becoming competent website developers. By following this program you will be able to build an impressive resume and portfolio.</p>
<h5>Where to Start</h5>
<p>To become a developer, you must first learn to think like a developer. Your first step is to take this bucket and mop, and begin cleaning my kitchen floor.</p>
<p>When you're finished, you'll need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A lot of helpful guides can be found on YouTube, but you'll need to purchase a few Udemy courses.
